# DevCalc
Software developer's calculator, for Android

A calculator made for the software developer.
Features:
* Convert between binary, decimal and hexadecimal
* Toggle bits with a tap
* Bitwise operations (OR, XOR, AND, NOT, and left- and right-shift)
* Dedicated increment and decrement buttons
* ... and regular old calculator stuff as well (add, subtract, multiply and divide)

I wanted a calculator similar to the old Windows calculator, but couldn't find one that satisfied my needs.
So I set out to create my own, and this is the result.

[Check out the release on the Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.akseltorgard.devcalc)

... or [download the APK right here on GitHub](https://github.com/torgard/DevCalc/releases/tag/1.0)

Planned features:
* Unsigned integers
* 64, 16 and 8 bits
* Octal
* Arithmetic and circular shift
* Display input as ARGB color
